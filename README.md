# LCA
Solution for "Leetcode 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree"

# Description

This repository contains a Python solution to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST). The LCA of two nodes 'p' and 'q' is the lowest node in the BST that has both 
'p' and 'q' as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
